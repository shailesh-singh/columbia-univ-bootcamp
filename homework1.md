# RippleNet
RippleNet commonly referred to as Ripple is a fin-tech company focusing on providing high-performance payments between businesses and individuals across the world. Ripple uses blockchain technology as their primary backbone for transferring money. The company started as Ripplepay in 2005 by Ryan Fugger to provide online financial services focusing on payments solutions. In 2011 Jed McCaleb lead the development of XRP, Ripples own cryptocurrency to orchestrate the next generation of online payments. The advent of XRP was to improve upon existing online ledger payment technology mainly Bitcoin. XRP’s most notable features are ensuring secured instant transfer of funds across the world at near real-time with fees that are extremely low compared to what is being charged by other financial services and banks. Ripple’s popularity is evident in its 13 rounds of funding that raised total of $293.8 million (based off Crunchbase data) and adaption by Earthport Service payment systems owned VISA which provides financial services to companies like Western Union, Bank of America and HSBC.

Some of the features that set Ripple’s payment using XRP apart from other platforms in this domain are:
* Ownership
* Transaction speed
* Cost of transfer

## Ownership
RippleNet is a Company focusing on payments just like Bitcoin does. However, being a private company with its organizational structure clearly defined and transparent to the public and other institutions gives them a professional demeanor. Bitcoin that holds the largest market cap does not have a clear transparent organizational structure and was created by an anonymous group or individual which makes it difficult to put confidence in using it as major payment system by banks.  

## Transaction speed
Ripple’s, XRP platform with existing use handles at an average of 1,500 transactions per second (TPS) and takes around 4 seconds to send payments and can scale up to 50,000 TPS. Bitcoin on the other hand does around 7 TPS and takes about 60 minutes to send payments. The reason for such contrasting difference is in the consensus protocol used to verify transactions over the decentralized network. The consensus used by Ripple is called Ripple Ledger or XRPL in short uses an anti-robustness principle that elevates reliability and performance. Bitcoin Ledger uses proof of work which takes a lot more computing power and time.

## Cost of transfer
XRPL consensus algorithm is computationally less expensive than other consensus protocol such as proof of work and proof of stake. Being computationally less expensive Ripple network powered by XRP costs less energy to run which also reduces the fees required to transfer money on their network. To avoid inflation caused by supply and demand of the digital tokens, Ripple minted a supply of 100 billion XRP tokens. So using Ripples network as a utility to transfer funds and assets with the large supply of tokens would allow financial companies such as banks and remittance groups to benefit from low cost deflationary tokens values.
